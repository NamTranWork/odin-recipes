        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Crispy on the outside, juicy and savory on the inside—these classic beef empanadas are the ultimate 
            comfort food. Made with flaky Goya Discos pastry rounds and filled with a rich blend of seasoned 
            ground beef, tangy tomato sauce, fragrant onions and garlic, and briny Spanish olives, each bite 
            delivers a bold burst of flavor. A touch of sofrito, Sazón with coriander and annatto, and oregano 
            brings that signature Latin flair.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep-fried until golden brown, these turnovers make the perfect appetizer, party snack, or even a 
            satisfying main course. Serve them hot and fresh with your favorite dipping sauce or enjoy them 
            solo—these empanadas are delicious no matter when or how you eat them.

        <!-- Steps Section -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir 
                until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 
                5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, sazón, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce the 
                heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. Spoon 
                about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with 
                water, fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to paper towels to drain. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
