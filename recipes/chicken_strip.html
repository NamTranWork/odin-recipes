        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This simple and satisfying recipe transforms everyday ingredients into a crunchy, flavorful chicken 
            dish the whole family will love. Tender strips of boneless, skinless chicken breasts are dipped in 
            melted butter, then coated with a savory blend of crushed crispy rice cereal, flour, and a salt-free 
            seasoning mix. Baked to golden perfection, these tenders come out juicy on the inside with a crispy, 
            flavorful crust—no frying needed!

            doubled or quadrupled for a crowd. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce or alongside a fresh salad 
            for a balanced meal.
